Daughter:
Ma, can I make you a cup of tea? Here, let me take your bag.
Mother:
Gosh, this is a surprise. Yes, some tea would be lovely. I’ve had a long day at work.
Daughter:
Here’s your tea. Ma, there is a school dance on Friday night. All the girls in my class are going. Can I go too?
Mother:
Ah! I thought there was a reason that you were being so helpful.
Daughter:
That’s not fair, Ma! I am always helpful.
Mother:
Okay, you are. I’m only teasing you. Tell me more about this dance.
Daughter:
It’s at the school hall. And it starts at 7pm.
Mother:
Are parents allowed to go?
Daughter:
Ma!
Mother:
What?
Daughter:
None of the other girls’ mothers will be there. And why do you –
Mother:
If I can go to check on what is happening, then you can go. Otherwise not. That’s final.
Daughter:
Well, if you’re sure
Mother:
Good. Now let’s talk about what you are going to wear. Do you need a party dress?
Daughter:
I can wear my blue dress from last year. It still fits. But my shoes don’t fit me any more.
Mother:
(smiles) Okay, let’s go shopping tomorrow.
Daughter:
(hugs her mother) You’re the best, Ma!
